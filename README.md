# Bors khan
A rewrite of my original khan collab robot. There's still a lot of work to do! As of writing, I have about 70% of the API implemented (albeit somewhat roughly). I'm planning on using POSIX commands this time, like `diff` and `patch` to be more accurate and to make my life easier. I've also redesigned the commands for clarity, but it's only jotted down in my notes currently.
